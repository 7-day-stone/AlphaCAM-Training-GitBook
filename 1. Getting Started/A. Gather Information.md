Then Scroll down until you find the attached files. You will find a zip file along with a few other files, download the zip file, as it contains all you need.

Once downloaded, go to the directory you downloaded the file to, copy the downloaded zip, and paste it in our `Program` folder. The directory for this folder is `\\SLABSMITH\Users\Public\Program`.
* This folder is not on your computer's local disk, it is on the computer labelled "SLABSMITH". You will need to be connected to the network to be able to access this folder.
* Anything you delete/add/change in this folder on your computer, will delete/add/change on *all* of our computers, so be careful what you are doing.

After you've pasted this zip folder, extract it right there into the program folder. Once extracted, delete the zip file and navigate to the extracted folder.

This folder has your job information inside of it. You'll want to start by opening the `pdf` that is titled `JOBNAME_print.pdf` or something similar.
* This file has information on the template files. it will tell you which dxf is what, and it will have some job photos as well that you may need to gain more understanding on the job you're programming for.

Once you figure out exactly which dxf files you're going to open, you can now open alphacam and get ready to start importing dxf files for work.
