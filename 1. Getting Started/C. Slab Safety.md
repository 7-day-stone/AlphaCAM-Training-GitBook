be **extremely careful when measuring slabs**

![do not walk in between slabs](http://tanner.havana.software/gr9D08)

**Never** walk in between slabs to get a measurement if you don't have to.

Slabs can tip over, poles can bend and break, you can get stuck and die if you're not careful. Never go in between slabs. So, if avoidable, never go in between slabs.

Another thing you want to be careful with, is getting into the *Slab fall shadow*. When a slab is being moved, especially if it's of a more brittle material, **do not** walk beside the face of the slab when it's being carried by crane. It can break where it's being carried and it will have a 50/50 chance of falling on you, or falling on whoever or whatever else is on the other side.
