Each color is a different layer and means something different. Usually, red means finished edge, green means flat polish, orange is for seams/miters, dashed white/black is for cabinet lines, and solid white/black is for walls and the sink center line

Begin by hiding all layers. We're going to first delete the lines we dont need

Start by unhiding the layer that the templator's dimensions are in, and delete them all. We will not ever be using the templator's dimensions, they are only for the templator to use to confirm their template is correct on site.

![Deleting Template Dimensions](../images/deletetemplatedims.gif)

After dimensions are deleted, unhide the gray layer and delete any lines that are in the gray layer.

Once deleted, we can begin defining our construction(reference) lines. These lines will not be seen by the machines and will only be used in our cover sheet file. We use reference lines as points of measure, visual guidance, and for placing our CNC toolpaths in when creating our cover sheet file
