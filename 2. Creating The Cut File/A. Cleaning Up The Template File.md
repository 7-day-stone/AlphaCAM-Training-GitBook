Each color is a different layer and means something different. Usually, red means finished edge, green means flat polish, orange is for seams/miters, dashed white/black is for cabinet lines, and solid white/black is for walls and the sink center line

Begin by hiding all layers. We're going to first delete the lines we dont need

Start by unhiding the layer that the templator's dimensions are in, and delete them all. We will not ever be using the templator's dimensions, they are only for the templator to use to confirm their template is correct on site.
