# Gather Information

## Introduction

When you're about to start a job, you will need to attend to the first thing on the program checklist, which is verifying information. There are several steps in the process of a job and information flows through several platforms and sources. Your job as a programmer is to filter through this information before you start programming. You are supposed to go through all information through all platforms and find any inconsistencies or issues.

## JobTracker

Jobtracker is the bible, most if not all information should be on a job's JobTracker page.

_The very top should hold all of the notes from both the salesperson and the templator._ Be sure to read these notes first, they will often have information that you will need to pay attention to in order to program your jobs. These may have some details that the templator missed, so it's always good to have the template pulled up right beside Job Tracker so that you could verify information.

Below are the _Job Activities_. Every job goes through a process, and every step of the process is scheduled and logged in the activities section for the job. You want to look at all of the activties and ensure that they look correct. If it's a home owner job, make sure that there is a `photo slabs` activity, and that there are slab IDs inside the activity notes. These are slabs that you will be using in Slabsmith to complete the job. if there are not any slab IDs, ensure that we even have the material at the shop. You will see material status in the activities as well. What you should pay most attention here in the activities section, is the program activity. Look for any notes left by somebody in this section, as they contain guidelines or instructions on what you need to do with this job to make it work.

## Email

Next check your email for any information. Type in the job address and look for any emails that may have information regarding this job.

Often times, there is information that was _not_ inputted into jobtracker, in your emails. While everybody should be putting job details into job tracker, there are plenty of times where this does not happen, so you must remain alert, and check emails for any problems

## Template

The template is what we use to cut the entire job, if something is missed here, it will ruin the job

Templators usually include a bunch of notes in their jobs for the programmer and salesperson to look at. Make sure you read all of these notes and if you have questions on anything that the templator says, ask Andrew or Alfonso what it means and what to do about it.

Keep Job Tracker open while you look at the template. Make sure everything looks correct and the job information matches what's on the template
