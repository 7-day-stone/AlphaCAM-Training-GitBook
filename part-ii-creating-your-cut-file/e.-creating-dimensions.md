# Creating Dimensions

Now that you've labelled your cut file, you're ready to start adding dimensions.

First thing to make sure of, is that you've created all the seams you need, and you've made your inside corner radiuses. Inside corner radiuses are always 2.5 inch radiuses. So you should be making these first before you do anyhting else

Now make sure that you've _only_ done your inside corner radiuses. **Do not do your outside corner radiuses before your dimensions**

You can now start adding dimensions. To add dimensions to anything, press `ctrl + d` to bring up the dimension menu

As you can see, there are lots of different options for dimensions. We will mainly be using `vertical`, `horizontal`, and `aligned`. In most cases, aligned dimensions is most of what you'll need, with the exception of maybe a vertical/horizontal dimension or two, for center line to corner measurements.

When creating dimensions, remember that you're dimensions are what the pieces should be **after** they've been on the CNC machine, so whenever you're measuring a finished edge, make sure to use those construction line offsets so you can have accurate measurements

When measuring lines with inside corner radiuses, you will start your dimension \(aligned\) from the center point of the radius, and then to the end of the line.
