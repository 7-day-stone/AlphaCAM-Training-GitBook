# Labelling Your File

The next step in making your finished file is labelling. We label things a very specific way and you will need to adopt these and not diverge from our label patterns at all, as everyone in the shop is trained to follow the way we label and color things to a tee.

So, to get started with labelling, we have a premade template for labelling things within Alpha cam. To get the labels imported into your file, press `insert` near the top of the alphacam window, inside the `home` tab. Then go to `\\SLABSMITH\Users\Public\Program` and select `PROGRAM TEMPLATE INSERT.asd`

Then go ahead and place the template near everything in your file.

To start off, we're going to put in some text, the Job Title\(Address\), Edge Style, Material, Sink information, and Backsplash information down in that order. To write text, you press `ctrl + t`. Now press `Ok` and write the job info out

Now we start labelling our pieces.

Start by numbering each piece. Using the move tool `m` give each piece a number

After pieces are numbered, we need to place the `X`s. The `X`s are the labels we put on finished edges. Put one X on each finished edge, right next to the edge.

Next are the Flat Polish labels. There are two Flat Polish labels. The Countertop Flat Polish label which is just `FP` and the backsplash Flat Polish label which is a symbol in the construction layer, that is a circle with an enclosing square, and a line crossing through it. 
Place the `FP` texts on countertops where ever there is a flat polish area, and place the backsplash FP label in the center of each edge that is getting a backsplash
