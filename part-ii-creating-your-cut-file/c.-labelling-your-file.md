# Labelling Your File

The next step in making your finished file is labelling. We label things a very specific way and you will need to adopt these and not diverge from our label patterns at all, as everyone in the shop is trained to follow the way we label and color things to a tee.

So, to get started with labelling, we have a premade template for labelling things within Alpha cam. To get the labels imported into your file, press `insert` near the top of the alphacam window, inside the `home` tab. Then go to `\\SLABSMITH\Users\Public\Program` and select `PROGRAM TEMPLATE INSERT.asd`

Then go ahead and place the template near everything in your file.

To start off, we're going to put in size 5 text, the Job Title\(Address\), Edge Style, Material, Sink information, and Backsplash information down in that order. To write text, you press `ctrl + t` and ensure the font size is 5. Now press `Ok` and write the job info out in all caps

It should look something like this

Now we start labelling our pieces.

Start by numbering each piece. There is a process to this as well. number the counter top pieces first in a clockwise direction

![labelled main pieces](http://tanner.havana.software/3ebc02)

If the piece is an island, place the number in the center. if it is any other counter top, place the number near the back _away from the finished edge_

Now we number our backsplashes and other pieces that arent counter tops

![backplash numbering](http://tanner.havana.software/osSF1J)

Notice how the backsplash numbers are close to their counter top's number. This is how they should be placed. If the piece is not a backsplash, then place the number close to where the top of the piece will be once it's cut.

Now that they're numbered, we are going to place our `X`s down.

`X`s are the labels we put on finished edges. Edges that go through the CNC machine are going to have x's on them. This is what they should look like

![X placement](http://tanner.havana.software/YFRKJo)

The X's that you place should not be too close to a corner. Reason being that the people working the CNC machine will not know if that's supposed to be a finished edge or not. If you place it in a corner, it could look like either side is a fnished edge, and they'd have to ask somebody to make sure.

You should also not place them super close to the geometry lines, instead placing them right behind the cab line.

Now we move onto FP\(Flat Polish\)

If you see a gap in between countertops and labels in between them that say things like `REF`, `RNG`, or `SLIDE IN`, like [this](http://tanner.havana.software/uexadj) then that means that the edge with the gap is a FP edge. Now, those arent the only other FP edges, you'll want to check your template info pdf file for edge information. Any green lines means it's a flat polish edge

![Fp vs finished edge](http://tanner.havana.software/qLzOzO)

Don't move the FP label over backsplashes, instead just put them on countertops and other pieces. Here is an example

Now copy your seam labels to your seams

Now if your job is a home owner job, you will need to include a cutting board. The cuttin board is included in the label template.

if not, then you're done with labelling with this template file, so you can now delete the left over labels
